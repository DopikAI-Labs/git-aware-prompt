# Git Aware Prompt

Working with Git and its great branching/merging features is
amazing. Constantly switching branches can be confusing though as you have to
run `git status` to see which branch you're currently on.

The solution to this is to have your terminal prompt display the current
branch. There's a [number][1] [of][2] [articles][3] [available][4] online
about how to achieve this. This project is an attempt to make an easy to
install/configure solution.

## Overview

If you `cd` to a Git working directory, you will see the current Git branch
name displayed in your terminal prompt. When you're not in a Git working
directory, your prompt works like normal.
